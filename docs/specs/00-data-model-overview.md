# Data Model Overview

**Module:** 00 — Data Model Overview
**Status:** Built (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress)
**Entities:** All 21

## Overview

This document is the master entity reference for the Utility CIS data model. It describes all 18 entities, their database tables, categories, the phase in which they were built, and their key relationships. Use this as the index when navigating module-level specs.

The system is multi-tenant: every entity is scoped by `utility_id`. Tenant isolation is enforced at the database level via PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, with the `utility_id` claim from the JWT applied per-request.

## Entity Summary

**24 entities** across 6 categories (RBAC category added in Phase 2; TenantConfig and SuspensionTypeDef added alongside Service Holds v1; CustomFieldSchema added in Custom Fields Phase 1):

| # | Entity | Table | Category | Phase Built | Key Relationships |
|---|--------|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Customer | `customer` | Customer | Phase 1 | Has many Accounts, Contacts, owns Premises |
| 2 | Contact | `contact` | Customer | Phase 1 | Belongs to Account; optionally linked to Customer |
| 3 | BillingAddress | `billing_address` | Customer | Phase 1 | Belongs to Account |
| 4 | Commodity | `commodity` | Reference | Phase 1 | Has many UnitOfMeasure, Meters, ServiceAgreements, RateSchedules |
| 5 | UnitOfMeasure | `unit_of_measure` | Reference | Phase 1 | Belongs to Commodity; referenced by Meter, MeterRegister |
| 6 | Premise | `premise` | Core | Phase 1 | Has many Meters, ServiceAgreements; optionally owned by Customer |
| 7 | Meter | `meter` | Core | Phase 1 | Belongs to Premise + Commodity + UOM; has many Registers, Reads, ServiceAgreementMeters |
| 8 | MeterRegister | `meter_register` | Core | Phase 1 | Belongs to Meter; referenced by MeterRead |
| 9 | Account | `account` | Core | Phase 1 | Belongs to Customer; has many ServiceAgreements, Contacts, BillingAddresses |
| 10 | ServiceAgreement | `service_agreement` | Agreement | Phase 1 | Belongs to Account + Premise + Commodity + RateSchedule + BillingCycle; has many ServiceAgreementMeters, MeterReads |
| 11 | ServiceAgreementMeter | `service_agreement_meter` | Agreement | Phase 1 | Junction: ServiceAgreement ↔ Meter |
| 12 | RateSchedule | `rate_schedule` | Configuration | Phase 1 | Belongs to Commodity; referenced by ServiceAgreement; self-references for versioning |
| 13 | BillingCycle | `billing_cycle` | Configuration | Phase 1 | Referenced by ServiceAgreement |
| 14 | MeterRead | `meter_read` | Operations | Phase 1 | Belongs to Meter + ServiceAgreement + UnitOfMeasure; optionally linked to MeterRegister. `uom_id` frozen at write time from the meter's UOM. |
| 15 | AuditLog | `audit_log` | System | Phase 1 | Records all entity state changes; references actor by user UUID |
| 16 | TenantTheme | `tenant_theme` | System | Phase 1 | One per utility (unique on utility_id) |
| 17 | UserPreference | `user_preference` | System | Phase 1 | One per user per utility (unique on utility_id + user_id) |
| 18 | Attachment | `attachment` | Operations | Phase 2 | Generic file attachment for any entity (entityType + entityId pattern); RLS enforced |
| 19 | Role | `role` | RBAC | Phase 2 | Per-tenant permission bundle; referenced by CisUser |
| 20 | CisUser | `cis_user` | RBAC | Phase 2 | Admin or portal user; belongs to Role; scoped by utility_id. Nullable `customer_id` FK to Customer — null for staff, set for portal customers. Portal users see only their own accounts/data via customer-scoped API endpoints. |
| 21 | TenantModule | `tenant_module` | RBAC | Phase 2 | Per-tenant module enablement (maps `moduleKey` → enabled) |
| 22 | TenantConfig | `tenant_config` | System | Phase 2 | One per utility (unique on utility_id); holds `require_hold_approval` and an extensible `settings` JSONB bucket carrying `numberFormats` (identifier generation), `branding`, `notifications`, `retention`, and `billing` namespaces (see spec 18). |
| 23 | SuspensionTypeDef | `suspension_type_def` | Reference | Phase 2 | Per-tenant (or global, with `utility_id IS NULL`) reference table for service-hold type codes. Replaces the former `SuspensionType` Prisma enum. RLS policy allows global rows to be visible across all tenants. |
| 24 | CustomFieldSchema | `custom_field_schema` | System | Phase 2 | One row per (utility, entity_type) holding the tenant's custom-field schema as a JSONB FieldDefinition array. Powers the `custom_fields` JSONB column on Customer/Account/Premise/ServiceAgreement/Meter. See spec 20. |

## Multi-Tenancy Model

Every table has a `utility_id UUID NOT NULL` column. RLS policies are enabled on all entity tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE premise ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON premise
  USING (utility_id = current_setting('app.current_utility_id')::uuid);
```

The API validates `utility_id` as a UUID before interpolation and sets the RLS context per-request via `SET app.current_utility_id`. Defense in depth: all `GET /:id` queries also include `utility_id` in the `WHERE` clause.

## Design Principles

- **Soft deletes only.** No hard deletes. Entities move to status `INACTIVE`, `CLOSED`, `REMOVED`, or `CONDEMNED`.
- **CIS owns utility domain; SaaSLogic owns money.** The integration boundary is a structured billing instruction.
- **Configurable, not customizable.** All tenant-specific variation is driven by data (commodities, rate schedules, billing cycles), not code branches.
- **Event-driven audit.** All state changes emit internal domain events that write to `audit_log` with before/after state.
- **Defense in depth for data integrity.** Zod validators guard the API boundary, Prisma constrains the schema, and PostgreSQL CHECK constraints enforce invariants at the storage layer. A bug in any single layer can't produce data that breaks the others.

## Database Invariants (CHECK constraints)

The following invariants are enforced at the PostgreSQL layer via CHECK constraints. They apply regardless of which service (or ad-hoc SQL session) writes the data. Zod mirrors these at the API boundary with friendlier error messages, but these are the backstop. The full list lives in `packages/shared/prisma/migrations/01_check_constraints/migration.sql` and is applied after RLS by `setup_db.bat`.

**Non-negative / positive numerics**
- `account.deposit_amount >= 0`
- `unit_of_measure.conversion_factor > 0`
- `meter.multiplier > 0`, `meter.dial_count > 0` (when not null)
- `commodity.display_order >= 0`
- `rate_schedule.version >= 1`

**Date ordering**
- `rate_schedule.expiration_date` is null or strictly after `effective_date`
- `service_agreement.end_date` is null or >= `start_date`
- `meter.removal_date` is null or >= `install_date`
- `service_agreement_meter.removed_date` is null or >= `added_date`

**Day-of-month bounds**
- `billing_cycle.read_day_of_month` and `bill_day_of_month` between 1 and 31. The CHECK is the calendar floor; Zod tightens this further to 1–28 at the API boundary (see [07 — Rate Management](./07-rate-management.md#billing-cycle)) to avoid month-end ambiguity. The two bounds are layered intentionally: Zod enforces the business rule, CHECK enforces physical possibility.

**Format checks**
- `customer.email`, `contact.email`, `cis_user.email` match a basic email regex (null allowed where the column is optional)
- `account.language_pref` matches IETF tag shape `^[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}$` (e.g. `en-US`)

**Non-empty business identifiers**
- `account.account_number`, `meter.meter_number`, `service_agreement.agreement_number`, `commodity.code`, `unit_of_measure.code`, `billing_cycle.cycle_code`, `rate_schedule.code` — all must be non-whitespace strings
